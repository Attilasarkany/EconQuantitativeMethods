This is the README file accompanying Project 1: Mortensen-Pissarides model

Language used: 
  Matlab

Main program file:
  main.m

Required function:
  Rouwenhorst.m

Results and graphs:   
  output.pdf


Procedures:
  1. set up the environment
  2. discretize the AR(1) process using the Rouwenhorst's method
  3. find the roots for the nonlinear system of equations
  4. derive the stationary distribution using iteration
  5. simulate a sequence from the AR(1) process and plot the results
