# Quantitative-Methods-in-Economics

Language used: Matlab

Poject 1: 
  1. Compute the discrete-time version of a Mortensen-Pissarides model with aggregate fuctuations
  2. Root-finding methods
  3. Discretize autoregressive(AR) process  
  4. Simulate from a Markov Chain by iteration

Project 2:
  1. Use Dynare (.mod) to compute the inpulse responses and simulated moments of a matching efficiency shock on a standard RBC model
  2. Benchmark RBC model: Cheremukhin, Restrepo-Echavarria, “The labor wedge as a matching friction,” (EER 2014)

Project 4:
  1. Value Function Iterations
  2. Discretize the state space; speed up by using monotonicity of policy and concavity of value function
  3. Represent the value function continuously using linear splines
